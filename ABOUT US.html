             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negros_Occidental_High_School"></a>
             <b>Negros Occidental High School (NOHS)</b></a>, located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, 
                Philippines, is the oldest public secondary educational institution in the province. Established on 
                July 1, 1902, it has a rich history spanning over a century.</p>

             <h2>ðŸ“ŒHISTORY</h2>
             <p>-Originally named <b>Instituto Rizal</b>, the school was founded with the efforts of former leaders of the 
                <b>Republica de Negros, Antonio Ledesma Jayme and Melecio Severino</b>. They were instrumental in its establishment, 
                with Jayme's house serving as the initial classrooms and dormitories. <b>The first principal was Ray Howell, who 
                led the school from 1902 to 1904</b>. Over the years, the institution underwent several name changes, becoming Rizal 
                Institute in 1914, Negros Occidental High School in 1921, and Bacolod High School in 1931.</p>
                  <br>
                 -The school has continually developed its facilities to provide a conducive learning environment. 
                 In November 2017, NOHS inaugurated a new four-story building with 20 classrooms, 
                 accommodating approximately 1,400 senior high school students.
